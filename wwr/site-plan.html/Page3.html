              Pattern: Cast on the desired number of stitches. For a standard adult-sized beanie, you can start with around 100 to 120 stitches. If you have a ribber, set it up for 1x1 ribbing.

              Ribbing rows: Knit in 1x1 ribbing (knit 1, purl 1) for about 1 to 1.5 inches, depending on your preference.
              
              Main Body:
              
              a. If you're using a ribber, transfer stitches from the ribber to the main bed.
              
              b. Continue knitting in stockinette stitch (all knit rows) for the desired length of the beanie. For a standard adult-sized beanie, knit until the total length reaches around 7 to 8 inches.
              
              Crown Decrease:
              
              a. Start the crown decrease by transferring every second stitch to an adjacent needle. Knit one row.
              
              b. Transfer the remaining stitches in the same way, leaving one empty needle between each stitch. Knit one row.
              
              c. Continue this process, gradually reducing the number of stitches on each row, until you have only a few stitches left.
              
              Before finishing, graphgan a 7 ball with black, white and burgunudy yarn. They can be found on pinterest.

              Finish:
              
              a. Cut the yarn, leaving a tail.
              
              b. Thread the tail through a tapestry needle and pass it through the remaining stitches.
              
              c. Remove the stitches from the machine and pull the tail tight to close the top of the beanie.
              
              d. Seam the side of the beanie using the mattress stitch or your preferred seaming method.
